# Time to talk tech

I've been thinking about starting a blog like this for a long time. The issue is, I never got around to doing it. 

So here I am. It's time to talk tech. I want to talk about tech out of a source of passion and interest, and talk about programming on a technical level. It's not just about programming in the end but also the interesting things that you see and learn along the way. And also: the opinions that you form about it all on the long journey to mastery. 

Or perhaps I just have some opinions and things that I have noticed after two years and five semesters of serious coding, and I want to express them openly, brazenly, and without any filter.

So here it is : an experiment, detached from my usual identity, in which I talk tech and share the things that I have learned along the way, and also any interesting thoughts and ideas about it. I think as developers and software engineers and basically programmers, we are in a very unique and fascinating field that we have chosen for ourselves, full of interesting observations and discoveries. Why keep them to ourselves? Technical writing can have a lasting influence : I still think about what Joel Sposky wrote so many years ago back when the internet landscape was completely different. 

But enough navel-gazing, it's time to start talking tech.
